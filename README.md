Vscode's origin goto line feature will move the page while you are still typing the line number.    
For example, if you want to goto 77th line, Vscode jumps to 7th line after you type 7 and jump to 77th line after you type another 7.    
It's so annoying, so I made this extension that you can goto line after pressing the enter.    
You can bind "Just Go To Line" to your Ctrl+G shortcut to replace the original one.
